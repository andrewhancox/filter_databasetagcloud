The database tags filter creates a tag cloud driven by the checkbox, linked checkbox and tag fields that can be put almost anywhere in the site, each tag will link back to a pre-populated search on the containing data activity.

block_databasetags, filter_databasetagcloud, datafield_linkedcheckbox and datafield_tag were created specifically for a resource database which can be seen at http://practicelearning.info/course/view.php?id=10. It was commissioned and funded by Focused on Learning, and coded and maintained by Andrew Hancox. We are certain this will be of use to others so we are contributing this development back in to the Moodle community.

### How do I get set up? ###

Place the files into filter/databasetagcloud and run notifications.

In order to use the filter use databasetagcloud_field_FIELDID in any block of filtered text.

This plugin has a dependency on block_databasetags.
